# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

This is the same command CI runs. The suite must pass before you open or update a pull request.

## Run

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Rules

- Never touch `infra/`. It is human-only.
- Synthetic data only. Test SSNs use areas 000, 666 or 900–999; test card numbers must fail the Luhn check. CI check `rai-data` enforces this.
- Never edit `migrations/`: data migrations need a human (label the issue `needs-human`). A `preToolUse` hook blocks agent writes there.
- Before working on an issue, read `plans/<issue>-progress.md` if it exists. At the end, update its Done / Decided / Next. Never redo Done or reverse Decided without a new Decided entry.
- Read `docs/decisions/` before changing behaviour; never contradict an Accepted ADR without a new ADR.
- See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for coding standards and `.github/instructions/` for path-specific rules. API rules (status codes, validation) live only in `.github/instructions/api.instructions.md`; don't restate them here.
