# Day 1: Cloud agent run artifacts

> GH-600 · Week 1 · Day 1: *Hand the agent an issue (and read its rulebook)*

## Bets

| Bet | My guess | Actual | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A**: Path-specific (`tests/**`) says *use fixtures*; repo-wide says *no fixtures*. What happens? | Only the path-specific file is sent | Both are sent; path-specific has higher priority | ❌ miss |
| **B**: Max execution time of one cloud agent session (minutes) | 5 | 59 (hard limit) | ❌ miss |

## SDLC fit

Which SDLC steps should go to an agent? *Agents propose; humans and policy accept.*

| ✅ Good for agents (scoped, testable, easy to verify) | ❌ Not for agents (judgment, high stakes, hard to undo) |
|---|---|
| **Well-scoped fixes**: a bug with clear repro steps and acceptance criteria | **Ambiguous product decisions**: open-ended tasks with no clear "done" |
| **Tests**: raising coverage on existing behaviour | **Cross-repo changes**: the agent can only change one repo per task |
| **Refactors / docs / dependency bumps**: small tech debt, README, Dependabot PRs | **Irreversible ops / production-critical**: deployments, infra, CI workflows, security/PII/auth |

**Screening-service example (good):** add input validation to `POST /transactions/screen` and tests for each `/alerts/{id}/close` disposition. Both are narrow, and CI proves them right or wrong.

**Screening-service example (not):** changing the alert threshold (score ≥ 50) or rule weights in `app/screening.py`, or touching `infra/` / `ci.yml`. That's compliance policy and platform risk, so a human decides and the agent can only write tests around it.

## Artifacts

Mission 5 issue: *Add input validation to POST /transactions/screen*. The agent ran **twice** (see timeline).

### Timeline (EDT, from git)

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 15:04 | I commit the instruction files on `rules/d01` ([fed1da7](https://github.com/mosherif-labs/github-labs/commit/fed1da7)) |
| 15:07 | **First agent run starts**: [PR #5](https://github.com/mosherif-labs/github-labs/pull/5), branch `copilot/add-input-validation-to-post-transactions-screen` |
| 15:12 | [PR #3](https://github.com/mosherif-labs/github-labs/pull/3) merged, so the instruction files reach `main` |
| 15:12 | **Second agent run starts**: PR #6, branch `…-again` |
| 15:14 | Agent pushes `8354245` (validation). **CI fails**: the old `"zz"` country in `test_screening.py` is now invalid |
| 15:14 | Agent pushes `af85d35` (fixture `"ZZ"`). **CI passes** |
| 15:21 | Copilot Code Review runs on PR #6 |
| 15:23 | I merge PR #6 |

**Lesson:** run 1 started *before* the rules were on `main`, so they weren't in the `main` branch it started from. Merge the rulebook first, then assign.

## Reflection

- What did the agent do that I didn't expect from the instructions I gave it?
- Financial-crime angle: which of today's artifacts would an auditor ask for first if an agent changed a screening rule?
